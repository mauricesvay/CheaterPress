CheaterPress
============

Demo

How to use
----------

HTML5 app that helps you cheat at LetterPress. 

- take a screenshot of the game's grid
- load it into the app
- get word suggestions that match the letters

How it works
------------

Cheaterpress uses File API to load screenshots and performs a very basic OCR to determine the letters being played. It then looks up into a dictionnary to find matching words.

Everything runs in the browser. Tested with modern ones (inc. iOS6 Safari).
